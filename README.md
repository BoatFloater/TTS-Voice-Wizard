Download a virtual audio cable, you can find one here https://vb-audio.com/Cable/


To be able to hear the TTS while outputing it though the microphone checkmark "listen to this device" for the virtual cable.
Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Select the Virtual Cable Output > Properties > Listen
(known issue, on computer restart listen to this device may not work. To fix this uncheck/apply and then recheck/apply changes.)
