# TTS-Voice-Wizard-Beta
This app allows you to convert your Speech to Text and back to Speech through Microsoft Azure Voice Recognition and TTS. It also allows you to send that text as OSC messages to VRChat which can be displayed on your avatar using KillFrenzyAvatarText. (P.S. I am new to this, I hope to make the app easier to setup in the future!)

# How to output TTS though microphone?
Upon clicking the TTS button you should be able to hear the TTS in the Sara voice by default (The app must have outputted audio for you to select it in volume mixer)

Download a virtual audio cable, you can find one here https://vb-audio.com/Cable/


To be able to hear the TTS while outputing it though the microphone checkmark "listen to this device" for the virtual cable.
Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Select the Virtual Cable Output > Properties > Listen
(known issue, on computer restart listen to this device may not work. To fix this uncheck/apply and then recheck/apply changes.)
