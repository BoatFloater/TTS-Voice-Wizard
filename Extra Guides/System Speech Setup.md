# Windows Built-In System Speech (Ignore if using Microsoft Azure Key)
- If you don't want to setup / use the Azure Conginitive Speech Services you can use your windows build in speech to text and text to speech engine. <br />
- Whats the difference you may ask?
    -  Azure can cost money if used too often as explained above in the "How to get your Microsoft Azure Key and Region" section
    -  Azure has better TTS voices and Speech recognition ability as demonstrated in the video above
- Setup: 
    - You will then need to change the Apps **output device**  to the **virtual cable** which will allow you to play the System Speech TTS though your microphone.
    - System Speech will always use default microphone. You can set this through control panel or for this app specifically through window sound settings
        - WINDOWS 10- Settings > Sound > App volume and device preferences<br />
        - WINDOWS 11- Settings > Sound > Volume Mixer<br />
        (find TTS voice wizard and change the input device to your microphone)<br />
