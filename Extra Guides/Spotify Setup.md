-  The Spotify feature is used to output the name of the song you are listening to in game. This feature currently has limited access. To enable this feature you must join the discord server and DM Wizard through discord to request access.
-  Spotify Setting are located in the addon tab. Once you have recieved access click the "Connect Spotify" button to connect your spotify.
- Once that's all working if you havent already you must install KAT on your avatar  to see the text in game https://github.com/VRCWizard/TTS-Voice-Wizard#killfrenzy-avatar-text
-  Emoji addon currently only works with Spotify and heartbeat, it replaces some text with a heart or the Spotify symbol for example.
    - How to add emojis: in unity replace the KAT texture with the png file provided in the "KAT Emoji Texture Sheet" folder and enable emojis in the app through the addon tab)
