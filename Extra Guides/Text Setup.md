- Another method which has text output on your avatar in VRChat is [Killfrenzy96's Avatar Text Displayer](https://github.com/killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText/) <br />
**Download KillFrenzy Avatar Text (KAT) latest release (supports 4, 8, or 16 sync parameters currently)**
    - Make sure to turn on "Send Text to VRChat with KAT" in TTSVoiceWizard Settings > Text Output 
    - If it isn't working after uploading your avatar, you may have to delete your %appdata%..\LocalLow\VRChat\OSC files when reuploading an avatar with new parameters
