 ## Option 2: KAT
- Another method which has text output on your avatar in VRChat is [Killfrenzy96's Avatar Text Displayer](https://github.com/killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText/) <br />
**Download KillFrenzy Avatar Text (KAT) latest release (supports 4, 8, or 16 sync parameters currently)**
    - Make sure to turn on "Send Text to VRChat with KAT" in TTSVoiceWizard Settings > Text Output 
    - If it isn't working after uploading your avatar, you may have to delete your %appdata%..\LocalLow\VRChat\OSC files when reuploading an avatar with new parameters
    - If you would like to add more functionaility to Killfrenzy Avatar Text. Frosty's Billboard is a KillFrenzy Avatar Text addon, it adds more functionality to the KAT such as making KAT grabbable and poseable. Download it from the "asset-showcase" channel in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/YjgR9SWPnW)

## Troubleshooting



-  Note: If you did this and the text does not appear then you must go to %appdata%..\LocalLow\VRChat and delete the OSC folder <br />
-  (Close VRChat, delete the OSC folder then restart VRChat is the proper order of operations)
