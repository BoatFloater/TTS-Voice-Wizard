
#### Web Captioner Speech to Text Instructions:
- Connect Web Captioner Webhook in TTS Voice Wizard
-  Go to https://webcaptioner.com/captioner 
-  Settings (bottom right) > Channels > Webhook
-  Set 'http://localhost:8080/' as the Webhook URL and experiment with different chunking values (I recommend a large value so it only sends when you finish talking). 
-  Now you're all set to click 'Start Captioning' in Web Captioner
